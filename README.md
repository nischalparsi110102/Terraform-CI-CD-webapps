# Terraform-Web-Application-
Terraform setup for AWS, with all the resources (Route53, Global Accelerator, ALB, ECS, CloudWatch Log Group) for three separate environments (dev, stage, prod) under terraform/Webapplication.If you fill in your variable values (like VPC ID, subnets, image, etc.), this setup will work out-of-the-box and avoid common pitfalls.
